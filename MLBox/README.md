# MLBox:

- MLBox is a powerful AutoML python library. It provides features such as:
1. Feature selection, missing value imputation, and outliers detection.
2. Optimized and faster data preprocessing.
3. Automatic hyperparameter optimization.
4. Automatic Model selection for classification and regression.
5. Model prediction with interpretations.
6. State-of-the-art predictive models for classification and regression (Deep Learning, Stacking, LightGBM, etc).


In comparison to other AutoML libraries, MLBox does missing value imputation to feature engineering using Entity Embeddings for categorical features. It also tries to make the distribution of train data similar to the test data (drift detection) along with model selection and hyperparameter optimization.
