## AutoKeras: 

- An AutoML system based on Keras. 
- It is developed by DATA Lab at Texas A&M University. 
- The goal of AutoKeras is to make machine learning accessible to everyone.
- It is built to find the best performing deep learning model for classification and regression.
- AutoKeras automatically searches for architecture and hyperparameters for deep learning models and trains them using the training data, and returns the best performing deep learning model are the final result.
- Auto-Keras follows the classic Scikit-Learn API design and therefore is easy to use.
- By using AutoKeras, you can build a model with complex elements like embeddings and reduction techniques 
- With AutoKeras, a neural architecture search algorithm finds the best architectures, like the number of neurons in a layer, the number of layers, which layers to incorporate, layer-specific parameters like filter size, or percent of dropped neurons in Dropout, etc.
- When we create a model using AutoKeras, much of preprocessing, like vectorizing or cleaning text data, is already done for you.
