# AutoML

AutoML refers to techniques for automatically discovering the best-performing model for a given dataset.

When applied to neural networks, this involves both discovering the model architecture and the hyperparameters used to train the model, generally referred to as neural architecture search.

**Hyperparameter optimization (HO) is the technique of finding the optimal values of different model hyperparameters such as learning rate, etc**

In simple words is a way of automating the tasks: 

- Preprocess and clean the data.
- Select and construct appropriate features.
- Select an appropriate model family.
- Optimize model hyperparameters.
- Postprocess machine learning models.
- Critically analyze the results obtained.
