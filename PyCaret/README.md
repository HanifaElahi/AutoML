# PyCaret:

- PyCaret is an open-source machine learning library available in Python language that uses a lower number of codes and aims to reduce the number of hypotheses to insights within a cycle of time in a Machine Learning experiment created. 
- Thus, it enables data scientists to perform end-to-end experiments more quickly and efficiently than other open-source machine learning libraries. 
- With only a few lines of code, PyCaret enables us to perform complex machine learning tasks. 
- A very simple and easy to use interface where all the operations performed are automatically stored in a custom PyCaret Pipeline that is fully orchestrated for and towards the development of models. 
- PyCaret comes wrapped around with several other frameworks as well, such as scikit-learn, XGBoost, Microsoft LightGBM, spaCy, to name a few.
- PyCaret enables one to perform both simple and moderately sophisticated analytical tasks that would have required more expertise to understand and perform. 
- PyCaret allows you to go from data preparation to model deployment in just a few seconds in the notebook environment you choose to run it in. 
- Whether adding missing values or transforming categorical data, engineering the present features or optimizing hyperparameters in the present data, PyCaret can help automate it all. 
- Its Machine Learning capabilities can also be seamlessly integrated with other environments supporting Python such as Microsoft Power BI, Tableau, Alteryx and KNIME. This gives immense power and flexibility to the users of these Business Intelligence platforms, who can now integrate PyCaret into the existing workflows and add a layer of Machine Learning without putting in much effort.

**PyCaret can be used for the following data processing and pre-processing use cases :**

- Data Preparation
- Training A Model
- Hyperparameter Tuning within the Model
- Creating Analysis and Deriving Interpretability
- Model Selection 
- Experiment Logging
