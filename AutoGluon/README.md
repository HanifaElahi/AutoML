# AutoGluon:

- AutoGluon is an autoML framework developed for deep learning workloads open-sourced by AWS. 
- Unlike other autoML libraries, that only support tabular data, it also supports Image classification, Object detection, Text, and real-world applications spanning image.

### AutoGluon enables you to:

- Find best performing deep learning architecture and hyperparameters.
- Automatic data preprocessing.
- Quickly prototype deep learning and classical ML solutions for your raw data with a few lines of code.
- Automatically utilize state-of-the-art techniques (where appropriate) without expert knowledge.
- Leverage automatic hyperparameter tuning, model selection/ensembling, architecture search, and data processing.
- Easily improve/tune your bespoke models and data pipelines, or customize AutoGluon for your use-case.
